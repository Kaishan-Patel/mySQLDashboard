MAMP provides them with all the tools they need to run WordPress on their desktop PC for testing or development purposes, for example. It doesn't matter if you prefer Apache or Nginx or if you want to work with PHP, Python, Perl or Ruby.

## Install MAMP

You'll need to grab the installer for [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) and install it. You'll want to use the MAMP installer and not the MAMP Pro version that also comes installed. 

### Boot up MAMP

By default the servers are handled on port 8889. You can access [mySQL] (http://localhost:8889/top) || (http://localhost:8889/weekly) for your databases.
